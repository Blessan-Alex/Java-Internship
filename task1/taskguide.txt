Image 1 (Task 1: Find Even or Odd Number)

Objective:
Develop a simple Java console application that allows the user to input an integer and checks whether the number is even or odd. This task introduces the fundamental concept of conditional logic and modulus arithmetic in Java. Understanding how to handle user input and apply basic decision-making structures is essential for every Java developer.
Tools:
• Java Development Kit (JDK)
• Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
• Command-line terminal (optional)
Key Concepts: Operators, If-Else, Modulus (%)
Steps:
• Ask the user to enter a number
• Use % operator: if num % 2 == 0, it’s even
• Display the result
