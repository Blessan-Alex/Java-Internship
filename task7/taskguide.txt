Image 1 (Task 7: Build REST API with Spring Boot)
- Objective:
  Develop a simple REST API for task management that supports CRUD operations and JSON data exchange.

- Tools: Java, Spring Boot, Maven/Gradle, Postman (for testing)

- Key Concepts: REST architecture, HTTP methods, JSON serialization, Spring Boot annotations.

- Steps:
  1. Initialize Spring Boot project (start.spring.io).
  2. Add dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA (optional).
  3. Create Task class with id, title, description.
  4. Create TaskController with CRUD endpoints.
  5. Use @RestController and mapping annotations.
  6. Test API using Postman with JSON requests/responses.
