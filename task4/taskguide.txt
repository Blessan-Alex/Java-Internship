Image 1 (Task 4: File I/O â€“ CSV Read & Write)
- Objective:
  Learn to read data from a file, process it, and write the result to another file in Java.

- Tools: Java, IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code), CSV file

- Key Concepts: File handling, reading/writing text files, parsing data, filtering using conditions.

- Steps:
  1. Create a sample products.csv file with name and price.
  2. Use BufferedReader to read lines from the file.
  3. Split each line by comma to get name and price.
  4. Convert price to double and check if > 1000.
  5. Use FileWriter to write matching products to a new CSV file.
  6. Print success message and verify new file.
